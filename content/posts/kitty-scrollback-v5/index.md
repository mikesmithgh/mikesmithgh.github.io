[kitty-scrollback.nvim v5.0.0](https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim/releases/tag/v5.0.0) is officially released!

## What is kitty-scrollback.nvim?

A Neovim plugin (and Kitty Kitten) that allows you to navigate your Kitty scrollback buffer to quickly search, copy, and execute commands in Neovim.

Check out the [README](https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim) for detailed information, the [Wiki](https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim/wiki) for additional configurations, and [Advanced Configuration Examples](https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim/wiki/Advanced-Configuration-Examples) for more demos!

## What changed?

See [Migrating to v5.0.0](https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim#-migrating-to-v500) for the detailed migration guide.

  - kitty-scrollback.nvim v5.0.0 uses Kitty's builtin `--bracketed-paste` option when sending commands to Kitty. The `--bracketed-paste` option was added in Kitty 0.32.2. If you are using an older version of Kitty, then upgrade to the latest version or at least 0.32.2.
  - Alternatively, if you are unable to upgrade Kitty, then you can still use tag [v4.3.6](https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim/releases/tag/v4.3.6) of kitty-scrollback.nvim.
  - See [kitten-send-text](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-control/#kitten-send-text) for more information on the `--bracketed-paste` option.

## Other minor version updates

  - Added experimental tmux support in v4.0.3! See [tmux (ðŸ§ª experimental )](https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#tmux--experimental-) for setup instructions.
  - A handful of bug fixes and smaller features, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.

## What's next?
The next feature I plan to work on is adding command-line editing support (see [#253](https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim/issues/253)). I also plan to 
complete the work necessary to move tmux support from experimental to stable.
